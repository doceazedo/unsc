# ðŸŽ§ UNSC

> Unlimited access to SoundCloud API

## Why UNSC?

SoundCloud has closed API application requests since forever and hasn't opened it again ever since. UNSC provides a API that scrappes the data from SoundCloud public pages and internal APIs.

## API

We implement endpoints as needed, if you need to read a SoundCloud API endpoint/page that we don't cover yet, please [open an issue](https://github.com/doceazedo/unsc/issues/new).
